## Project Overview

### Purpose

The Computer Programming Skill Swap Platform aims to solve the problem of finding personalized learning opportunities for computer programmers. Users can exchange skills with others through virtual sessions, avoiding high tutoring costs. The platform focuses on skill-sharing rather than traditional mentorship, offering tools for collaboration, reviews, and feedback.

### Key Features

* **User Profile Pages:** Users can create and manage profiles with skill listings, expertise levels, and teaching packages.
* **Skill Matching:** Interactive charts and filters suggest potential skill-swap partners.
* **Swap Scheduling:** A calendar system allows users to schedule and confirm swap sessions.
* **Rating & Review System:** Users can rate their swap sessions, providing feedback to others.
* **Groups & Forums:** Create or join groups, participate in discussions, and learn in a collaborative environment.
* **News & Trends:** Stay updated with the latest programming trends, tutorials, and resources.
* **Secure Payment Gateway:** A secure payment system for users who wish to sell their educational materials.

### Main Features

* **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication system for user registration and login.
* **Interactive Skill Matching:** Filters to sort potential swap partners based on programming languages, frameworks, and experience levels.
* **Booking & Scheduling System:** Users can set their availability and request swap sessions via an integrated calendar.
* **Review System:** After each swap, users can rate the session and provide feedback.
* **Forum:** A community-driven discussion forum where users can ask questions and share experiences.
* **Groups:** Users can form or join study groups based on their learning interests.
* **Shopping:** Users can purchase or sell coding materials through the platformâ€™s online store.

### Project Workflow

#### GitHub Repository

  https://github.com/NesliHumber/group9_project.git

#### Branches:

  + main
  + deploy
  + develop
  + feature/forums_page
  + feature/groups_page
  + feature/shop_page
  + feature/find_swap_page
  + feature/home_page
  + feature/about_us
  + feature/contact_page
  + feature/trends_and_news
  + feature/user_dashboard
  + feature/sign_up
  + feature/sign_in


* **main:** The main branch where the stable code resides.
* **develop:** Used for integrating all features before deployment.
* **deploy:** Used for deploying all functionalities before transfering the codes to main branch.
* **feature/<feature-name>:** Page-specific branches for development.
* **Pull Requests:** Changes are merged into the develop branch via pull requests, with at least one peer review required for approval.

### Issues & Project Board:

* 10 issues are created and closed after functionality development.
* GitHub issues (closed) link: https://github.com/NesliHumber/group9_project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed

* Project Board Link: https://github.com/users/NesliHumber/projects/1/views/2

### Development Phases

* Phase 1: Setup repository, implement user registration, and initial profile management.
* Phase 2: Develop skill matching, swap scheduling, and user dashboard functionalities.
* Phase 3: Add rating/review system, forums, and shop page.
* Phase 4: Manual testing, deployment, and bug fixing.

### Challenges & Solutions

* **Challenge 1:** Integrating the Swap Scheduling Feature
* **Solution**: We researched different calendar libraries and successfully integrated a custom solution to handle date/time selection and swap session confirmations.

* **Challenge 2:** Payment Gateway Integration
* **For future versions:** we search for a secure payment provider to integrate our user-friendly checkout flow to ensure smooth payment processing.

* **Challenge 3:** Since deployment of the web site was the main goal for this phase, the process of incorporating the feature/branch folders into deployment process was the main challenge for this phase. 
* **Solution:** We decided to continue our functionality development process via pushing separate feature/<feature-name> branches per web page and creating pull request from these branches to the develop branch on the remote. For the deployment, we decided to create a separate deploy branch on the remote and we added last version of every functionality to deploy branch. Our website deployment is rooting from this deploy branch until future version upgrades.

* **Challenge 4:** Connecting all pages together under navigation bar interactively via active URL absolute paths was the second challenge during development process. 
* **Solution:** Our strategy is to use the same navigation bar codes inside every page with a common .css styling.
